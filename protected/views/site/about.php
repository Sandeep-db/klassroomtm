            <h3 class="display-6">Here are some key features of Yii 1.1:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>MVC architecture: Yii 1.1 follows the MVC architecture pattern, which separates application logic into three components: the model (which represents the data and business logic), the view (which displays the data to the user), and the controller (which handles user input and updates the model and view).</li>
                <li>Active Record: Yii 1.1 includes an Active Record implementation, which provides an object-oriented interface for working with databases. This makes it easy to create, read, update, and delete records in a database without writing SQL code.</li>
                <li>Extensions: Yii 1.1 has a powerful extension system that allows developers to easily add new functionality to their applications. The extension repository contains hundreds of extensions that can be easily installed and used in Yii applications.</li>
                <li>Gii code generator: Yii 1.1 includes a powerful code generator called Gii, which can generate code for models, controllers, views, and more. This can save developers a lot of time and effort when building applications.</li>
                <li>Caching: Yii 1.1 has a caching system that supports several popular caching methods, including APC, memcached, and file-based caching. This can help improve application performance by reducing the number of database queries and other expensive operations.</li>
                <li>Security: Yii 1.1 includes a number of security features, including input validation, output encoding, and encryption. This helps protect applications from common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Overall, Yii 1.1 is a mature and well-established framework that provides a solid foundation for building web applications. It has a large and active community of developers who continue to maintain and improve the framework, and it is a great choice for developers looking to build fast, secure, and scalable web applications.
